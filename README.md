## Background
I don't want to initiate a blank CDK project anymore. So this is what I created.

You can use this to deploy infra from your machine, or even with a CDK pipeline with just a little twist!

## Requirements
Of course a PC (I'm using MacOS, so installation guide gonna be for MacOS)

1. AWS CLI

    https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html
2. npm
3. CDK Typescript
    ```sh
    npm -g install typescript    
    ```
4. AWS Credential (I will use AWS SSO Account with --profile flag)

## Stacks structure
The template include 3 major stacks, and will be (should be deploy in exact sequent):
- Base Network
- Stateful Resources
- Stateless Resources

Optional stack:
- Non Production

This is just an example stack. In this stack I created automation to shut down resources temporary outside business hour (not meant to use in production)

You can deploy Stateful or Stateless independently, but they will still be depended on BaseNetwork stack .<bR>
In other word, BaseNetwork will be created no matter which stack you create first.

You can extend to more subsequent stacks. But the less stacks the better.

**⚠️⚠️⚠️Please also keep in mind that this stack will be deploy in Tokyo Region as default⚠️⚠️⚠️**<br>
Set different region in .env file if needed to.

## Files structure and its meaning
```sh
pitaya-cdk-template
├── assets
│   └── lambda-code.py #example lambda function's code
├── bin
│   └── pitaya-cdk-template.ts # entry point, stacks will be loaded here
├── lib #stacks' definition folder
│   ├── parameters 
│   │   ├── constants.ts #constants through out project
│   │   └── env-config.ts #load parameter from .env.${deployEnv} files below
│   ├── base-network.ts #BaseNetwork Stack
│   ├── non-production.ts #Non Production Stack
│   ├── stateful-resources.ts #Stateful Stack
│   └── stateless-resources.ts #Stateless Stack
├── .env.dev #parameters for dev environment
├── .env.stg #parameters for stg environment
└── .env.prod #parameters for prod environment
```

## Commands
You need to specify which environment to deploy with context **deployEnv** and supply it on every cdk command. <br> 

`-c deployEnv=dev`

### Git clone and bootstrap cdk to your AWS account
```sh
# Clone project
git clone git@github.com:long2205/pitaya-cdk-template.git
```

Register account ID (and default region) in lib/constants.ts
```sh
# Bootstrap to your AWS
cdk bootstrap -c deployEnv=dev --profile 𝘺𝘰𝘶𝘳-𝘱𝘳𝘰𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘦-𝘯𝘢𝘮𝘦
```

### Deploy stacks
Stacks will be deploy in sequential order.

Deploy commands with development environment:
```sh
# Deploy Base Network
cdk deploy -c deployEnv=dev --profile 𝘺𝘰𝘶𝘳-𝘱𝘳𝘰𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘦-𝘯𝘢𝘮𝘦 BaseNetwork

# Deploy Stateless resources
cdk deploy -c deployEnv=dev --profile 𝘺𝘰𝘶𝘳-𝘱𝘳𝘰𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘦-𝘯𝘢𝘮𝘦 StatelessResource
# Stateless stack is depended on BaseNetwork Stack. Hence when deploy, it also deploys/check changes BaseNetwork Stack. The same with Stateful Stack
```

### Delete stacks
Sometimes, you need to re-create stack. Or your business is gone and you need to delete it. 

Deleting stacks should be delete by later-most order.

Which means the latest stack should be delete first, then the upmost BaseNetwork stack will be delete.

```sh
cdk destroy -c deployEnv=dev --profile 𝘺𝘰𝘶𝘳-𝘱𝘳𝘰𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘦-𝘯𝘢𝘮𝘦 StatelessResource

cdk deploy -c deployEnv=dev --profile 𝘺𝘰𝘶𝘳-𝘱𝘳𝘰𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘦-𝘯𝘢𝘮𝘦 BaseNetwork
# If you only run BaseNetwork delete command, all stacks will be delete, not just BaseNetwork stack
```

## Future improvements
- Wrapped all the stacks into a [CDK Pipeline](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/cdk_pipeline.html) 

(This is the main reason I put parameters into .env file, but for now I still prefer control from local machine)
- Introduce [cdk-nag](https://github.com/cdklabs/cdk-nag)
